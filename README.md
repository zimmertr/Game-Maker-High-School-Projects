#High School Programming Projects - Circa 2008-2009

##Foreward
**PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I WAS 14 YEARS OLD WHILE MAKING THESE PROJECTS**

These projects do not use current technology, reflect a good programming methodology or understanding, or use modern subject matter. I simply put thse on GitHub as a friendly reminder to myself of where I came from as well as a `trophy` of sorts to demonstrate how long computer programming has been an important part of my life. 

##Summary
This repository is a collection of my homework, projects, and labs from my computer programming class in high school around 2008. These projects all use Game Maker 7.

#Game Maker

Using Game Maker, I created four different games. Unfortunately, they were written in Game Maker 7 which won't run on modern operating systems and the games fail to import into newer versions of Game Maker Studio. In order for me to get these screenshots it was necessary for me to spin up a Windows XP VM and install an older version of Game Maker.

##Maze Game

A puzzle game heavily themed after The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. The objective is to navigate through the maze while avoiding contact with the various enemies and grab the key. Once you have grabbed the key, you can unlock the door and advance to the next level.

The game has cheat codes included into it which you type into the main menu. After clearing each level you'll obtain a code that you can use to skip back to that point to avoid having to replay the entire game over and over to progress. 

The game has many different enemies in it that move in random or scripted attack patterns as they attempt to attack you. # different songs which are loaded during different levels. A different background for every stage. A different sprite for each direction that Link moves in. 

If you're struck by an enemy, a message is displayed asking if you want to replay the level or quit playing.

When you start up the game in Game Maker, you're greeted with this screen which shows concept art from the Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker. On the bottom you can see a progress bar to show how far in the loading process you are as well as text displayed on the left side of the bar showing which componenets are being loaded into memory.

After the game is finished loading you're brought to the main menu where you can elect to either start playing, read about how to play the game, or exit out of the game.

This is what appears when you choose to read about how to play.

When you start playing the game, the first stage the player encounters is quite simple and is meant to teach them how to play the game. On it you'll find a zig zag maze pattern and several `Red Copy` enemies. `Ganon's Theme` is the song in the level.

The second level is when the difficulty begins to increase. Several `Stalfos` enemies bounce around the room and the key is guarded by a `Helmasaur King` in the bottom left corner. The `Gerudo Valley` theme song is played in this level. This level can be triggered with the cheat code `x`.

The third level has `Snap Dragon` and `Black Soldier` enemies and plays the `Water Temple` theme song. This level can be triggered with the cheat code `g`.

The fourth level has `Skeleton Knight` and `Eyegore` enemies and plays the `Dungeon` theme song. This level can be triggered with the cheat code `y`.

The fifth level has many `Darknut` and `Wizzrobe` enemies and their speeds are much faster than the previous levels. The `lost woods` theme song is played here and I believe it is the hardest level in teh game. This level can be triggered with the cheat code `v`.

The sixth level is unfinished. But it has a single `Vire` enemy and the `Lon Lon Ranch` song plays. This level can be triggered with the cheat code `7`.

When you've cleared all of the levels, a final splash screen is displayed where the user can choose to play again or quit the game. The info feature is unimplemented and I can't remember what it was supposed to do. The main `Legend of Zelda` theme is played while you're on this screen.

##Pong

Pong is a very simple game and functions just like the one you're used to. The left paddle is controlled by `w` and `s` and the right paddle is controlled with `up` and `down`. As a point is made the score will increase for the player denoted at the top of the screen and the ball will reset in the middle. Clicking the `Quit Pong` option on the top right will exit the game.

##Platform Game

Platform game was an attempt at learning how to use physics with video games. Pressing and holding `up` on your keyboard will cause your character to jump and using the other directional keys will allow you to navigate through the various levels.

##Ball Game

Ball game was my first game that I made and is very simple. You click on the balls as they bounce around the screen rapidly and for each one you successfully click you will gain a point. Your score is displayed on the top left of the window.
